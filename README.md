<strong>Question 1</strong>: There are two players and suppose that player 2 has complete information about it’s two types: type L and type H. Type L loves going out with player 1 whereas type H hates it. Player 1 has only one type and is uncertain about player 2’s type and believes the two types are equally likely. The two actions available to each player is: {<em>F,B</em>}. The payoff matrices are as follows:

<strong>Question 3</strong>: Consider the Cournot duopoly model with imperfect information about costs as discussed in class. That is, consider the situation where firm 1’s unit cost (<em>c</em>) is known by both firms, but only firm 2 knows its own unit cost. Firm 1 believes that firm 2’s cost is <em>c<sub>L </sub></em>with probability <em>θ </em>and <em>c<sub>H </sub></em>with probability 1 − <em>θ</em>, where 0 <em>&lt; θ &lt; </em>1 and <em>c<sub>L </sub>&lt; c<sub>H</sub></em>. Now assume that the (inverse) demand in the market is given by: <em>P</em>(<em>Q</em>) = <em>α </em>− <em>Q </em>for <em>Q </em>≤ <em>α </em>and <em>P</em>(<em>Q</em>) = 0 for <em>Q &gt; α</em>. Assuming that all outputs are positive in the Bayes Nash equilibrium, what is the equilibrium?

<strong>Question 4</strong>: Consider a variant of the Bayesian game of first-price auction discussed in class in which the players are risk averse. Specifically, suppose each of the <em>n </em>players’ preferences are represented by the expected value of the payoff function <em>x</em><sup>1<em>/m</em></sup>, where <em>x </em>is the player’s monetary payoff and <em>m &gt; </em>1. Suppose also that each player’s valuation is distributed uniformly between 0 and 1. Show that the game has a symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium in which each type <em>v<sub>i </sub></em>of each player <em>i </em>bids .

<strong>Question 5</strong>: Consider the all-pay auction as discussed in class. There are <em>n </em>bidders and <em>v<sub>i </sub></em>is independently and identically distributed according to the uniform distribution [0<em>,</em>1].

The payoff to a bidder <em>i </em>is <em>v<sub>i </sub></em>− <em>b<sub>i </sub></em>if <em>b<sub>i </sub>&gt; max<sub>j</sub></em><sub>6=<em>i</em></sub><em>b<sub>j </sub></em>and −<em>b<sub>i </sub></em>if <em>b<sub>i </sub>&lt; max<sub>j</sub></em><sub>6=<em>i</em></sub><em>b<sub>j</sub></em>. Find the symmetric (Bayes-Nash) equilibrium bidding function. (<em>Hint: First write down the expected payoff for a player i assuming everyone bids according to the symmetric equilibrium. Then write down the first order condition and use inverse function theorem. Finally, solve the resulting differential equation.</em>)

<strong>Question 6</strong>: Consider the following auction problem: a seller has a single item for sale worth nothing to him. There are two buyers, each draws a “type” independently with equal probability from the set {$8<em>,</em>$12}. Consider a sealed bid second price auction in which the only possible bids are $8 or $12. Let <em>p </em>denote the second price in the auction. What is the expected revenue to the seller if each buyer <em>i </em>values the item equal to his own type <em>t<sub>i</sub></em>? That is, the winner gets <em>t<sub>i </sub></em>− <em>p </em>and the loser gets 0.
